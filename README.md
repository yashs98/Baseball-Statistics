# Baseball-Statistics

I worked with another teammate on figuring out which player's statistic/statistics is the best indicator to determine which players are the most valuable to the team. We used statistics like awards the players have earned and their capabilities in different areas like batting, pitching, fielding, etc. This was done by primarily organizing the data into a relational database in SQL.

I used the baseball statistics from the following github repository:
